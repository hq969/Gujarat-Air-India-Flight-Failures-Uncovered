# ✈️ Gujarat-Air-India-Flight-Failures-Uncovered

A data-driven project that analyzes and visualizes aviation accidents involving Gujarat-based flights and Air India. This project explores the causes, patterns, and fatal outcomes of plane crashes using real and simulated data. It also integrates machine learning to predict fatal outcomes based on weather, aircraft type, flight phase, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

This end-to-end project includes:

- ✅ Combined analysis of Gujarat and Air India crash records  
- ✅ Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visual storytelling  
- ✅ Predictive modeling using Random Forest  
- ✅ Summary reports and visual exports  
- ✅ CSV outputs and ready-to-use data for dashboards
